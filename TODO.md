WIP

# TODO
(1) Nicer UI design
(1.5) Move defaults to object
(2) Add Typescript
(3) GA events?
(4) Domain and website?

# Notes
- Double check if manifest's permission are OK due to chunk hashes being dynamic

# Future ideas
- Use chrome.tabs.insertCSS instead of creating style tag: the caveat is that removeCSS is not supported in Chrome yet (FF only)
